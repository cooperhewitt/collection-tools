collection-tools
==

Tools for working with museum collections.

They are derived from tools originally written for the [Cooper-Hewitt collections data](https://github.com/cooperhewitt/collection) releases but should be general purpose enough to be applied in other contexts.

They are still a work-in-progress. In particular their lack of documentation.
